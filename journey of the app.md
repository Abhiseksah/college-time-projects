1.first of all i have created this with various functions in python.the functions are

  Board()-which is nothing but the game board and a python list...

  Display()-in this i am displaying the board after every click of the user...

  check winner()

    check row()-checking row...
  
    check coloum()-checking coloumn...
  
    check diagonal()-same as the prevous one...
  
    check tie()-if the game is tie then it prints that the game is tie...
  
  check range()-checking if the user enter the no is b\w 1-9 or not...

2.In the 2nd update one beautiful feature is added which is paly again.play again is a function

play again(1/0)-if game is tie or if someone wins the game then the app will ask if you want to play again or not.if yes then the game will run if no the game will stop.
